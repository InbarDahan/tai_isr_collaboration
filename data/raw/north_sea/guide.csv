Fields,Description
Quarter,Cruise quarter
Country,DATRAS code for the country that performed the survey. Ship flag does not affect this field
Ship,DATRAS ship reference code.
Gear,Gear type code
SweepLngt,"Length of sweep in metres. Recommended: at 1st quarter=60m (incl.backstorps) if depth<70m, or =110m if depth >70m. In other quarters=60m (see the manual for more info)"
HaulNo,"Sequential numbering of hauls during cruise.
In CA-records: HaulNo=-9 for Area-based ALK
HaulNo<>-9 and >0 for Haul-based ALK"
Year,Cruise year (YYYY)
TotalNo,"Total number of fish in the given haul and species. =Sum(HLNoAtLngt)*SubFactor; =NoMeas*SubFactor, but if DataType in HH is C, then = TotNo/hour/haul"
Sci_name,Scientific name of species
Month,Month of the haul (MM). Quarter-related numeric value.
Day,Calendar date of the haul (DD). Year and Month-related.
DayNight,"Daytime is recommended for trawling, See the NS-IBTS manual for more details."
ShootLat,Shooting position: Degree.Decimal Degree of latitude
ShootLong,Shooting position: Degree.Decimal Degree of longitude.
Depth,Depth from the surface in metres.
HaulVal,"Haul validity code. Related with SpecVal from HL. F.ex. if HaulVal is I, SpecVal should be 0."
DataType,"Code that specifies the data type for a number of fields in HL-record. 
C - TotalNo and CatCatchWgt are adjusted per hour of hauling;
R and S - raw data as recorded during the cruise.
S should be applied only if whole catch was sub-sampled, so SubFactor for the hole is > 1."
GRIDID,Grid cell name
